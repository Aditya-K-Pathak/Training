        <p>
          Hi! I'm Aditya Pathak, I'm from Bihar and currently I'm pursuing my
          Bachelor of Technology from Chandigarh Group of College, Landran.
          Talking about my skills I'm proficient in Python programming language
          and Full-Stack Web development. Other than these I have made several
          project for which I have filed patents and wrote Research papers.
          <br />
          In terms of Real world projects and experience I have built a website
          for our College Chandigarh Group of College to organize a confrence
          for authors of Research Papers. The papers were published in Springer
          and the conference was sponsored by All India Council of Technical
          Education (AICTE).
          <br />
          Moreover, I have won a few inter-college coding contests and
          ideathons. Other than these I have presesnted my project to the head
          of Niti Aayog on 1st December 2021 and to the Speaker of Punjab Vidhan

            The project is using a deep learning algorithm YOLO v5 which is
            about 2.5 times faster than other CNN algorithms <br />
            As output, it tells the user the name of object present in front of
            the user/camera <br />
            It can be used as motion sensor camera of surveillance camera <br />
